**CosUI** is designed to solve the biggest problem in the Python ecosystem: building user interfaces that don't look like they belong in Windows 95. Unlike Tkinter or heavy wrappers like PyQt, CosUI is built from the ground up for the modern era.

## ✨ Why CosUI?

- **🎨 Modern by Default:** No need to tweak CSS or themes. Buttons, cards, and inputs look professional instantly.
- **🚀 GPU Accelerated:** Powered by OpenGL (via Pyglet/Skia) for silky smooth 60fps animations.
- **🐍 Pythonic Syntax:** Declarative code structure inspired by SwiftUI and Flutter, but made for Python.
- **📦 Lightweight:** Zero compilation required. Just pure Python power.
